    <p>My Brother Archdiocesan Priests:</p>
    <p>
      Over the 37 years I have served in our Archdiocese, I had three separate
      portrait photos taken. The last two were in the choir dress of a Cardinal.
      Now as I near the last leg of my own priestly journey, I thought it
      opportune to have a final photo takenâ€”but this time, one which reflected
      more fully the gift of the Eucharist and the ministry of Jesus which we
      share. This photo was meant to harmonize with the call of Pope Francis for
      us to be humbler, showing compassion and mercy, and being with our people
      in servant leadership. When I retired, the image of the Unprofitable
      Servant [Luke 17:7&ndash;10] helped to focus me these past years. This is
      a sample of the new photo:

    <p>
      I already sent a signed an 8 x 10 copy to all the Archdiocesan priests
      whom I have had the privilege to ordain to the Sacred Priesthood. A few
      others have inquired about getting a copy, and I would be more than
      delighted to send signed copy to any Archdiocesan priest who requests one.

      Please complete the attached form and return to me. Please indicate how
      you wish the photo signed, and print that out for me. This will help
      eliminate errors on my part.
    </p>
    <p>The 8 x 10 photo will be sent, of course, free of charge.</p>
    <p>Please know of my prayers and support!</p>
    <p>Fraternally yours in Christ,</p>
    <br />
    <p>Cardinal Roger Mahony</p>
